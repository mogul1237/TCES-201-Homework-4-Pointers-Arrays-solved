This homework tests your understanding of the topics covered in the fifth and sixth weeks
related to C Programming – Pointers and Arrays.
CES Airline has just purchased a computer for its new automated reservations system. The
president has asked you to program the new system. You’ll write a program to assign seats
on each flight of the airline’s only plane (capacity: 10 seats). Your program should display a
menu of alternatives:
Please type 1 for first class
Please type 2 for economy
Please type 3 for seat chart
Please type 4 to quit
If the person types 1, then your program should assign a seat in the first class section (seats
1– 5). If the person types 2, then your program should assign a seat in the economy section
(seats 6– 10). Your program should then print a boarding pass indicating the person’s seat
number and whether it’s in the first class or economy section of the plane. Use a singlesubscripted array to represent the seating chart of the plane. Initialize all the elements of
the array to 0 to indicate that all seats are empty. As each seat is assigned, set the
corresponding element of the array to 1 to indicate that the seat is no longer available. Your
program should, of course, never assign a seat that has already been assigned. When the
first class section is full, your program should ask the person if it’s acceptable to be placed
in the economy section (and vice versa). If yes, then make the appropriate seat assignment.
If no, then print the message “Next flight leaves in 3 hours.”
The starter code (ces_airline.c) is provided with the homework along with an executable to
check the functionality. Please run the executable to understand the behavior. Do not
modify the main or assign functions. Write the code for the other functions that main and
assign call or use.
Submission Instructions: Submit the code on Canvas under hw4 Submission link.
Each program must contain a header in the following format modified for the
